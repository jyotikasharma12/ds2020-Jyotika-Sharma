ode to an academic advisor

# Crappy: What's the worst thing that happened since school started?
I missed a class the week after Labor Day Weekend because I forgot it was Tuesday and we had Monday off, so I missed my first lecture

# Happy: What's the best thing that happened since school started?
I have a very light schedule and I don't have very many assignments!
